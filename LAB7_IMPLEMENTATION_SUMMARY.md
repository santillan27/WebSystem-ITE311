$routes->post('admin/course/(:num)/upload', 'Materials::upload/$1');

// Materials routes (all users)
$routes->get('materials/download/(:num)', 'Materials::download/$1');
$routes->get('materials/delete/(:num)', 'Materials::delete/$1');
$routes->get('materials/course/(:num)', 'Materials::viewCourse/$1');
```

---

### 8. Directory Structure
**Created:** `writable/uploads/materials/`

**Purpose:** Secure file storage location
- Located in writable directory (not publicly accessible)
- Permissions: 0777 (read/write/execute)
- Files stored with random names for security

---

## Security Features Implemented

### 1. File Validation
- **Type checking:** Only allowed file extensions accepted
- **Size limit:** Maximum 10MB per file
- **Server-side validation:** Cannot be bypassed by client

### 2. Access Control
- **Upload:** Only admin and teacher roles
- **Download:** Only enrolled students + admin/teacher
- **Delete:** Only admin and teacher roles
- **Session verification:** All actions require logged-in user

### 3. File Storage Security
- **Random filenames:** Prevents file name conflicts and guessing
- **Writable directory:** Outside public web root
- **No direct access:** Files only accessible through controller

### 4. Database Security
- **Foreign keys:** Maintain referential integrity
- **Cascading deletes:** Remove orphaned records
- **Input sanitization:** Using CodeIgniter's built-in protection

## Database Relationships

```
users (id)
  ↓
courses (instructor_id → users.id)
  ↓
materials (course_id → courses.id)
  ↓
enrollments (course_id → courses.id, user_id → users.id)
```

**Key Points:**
- Materials belong to courses
- Courses belong to instructors
- Students enroll in courses
- Only enrolled students can download materials
