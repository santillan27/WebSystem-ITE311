# Laboratory Exercise 7 - File Upload System Testing Guide

## Overview
This document provides step-by-step instructions for testing the file upload and materials management system for the LMS.

## Prerequisites
- XAMPP running (Apache and MySQL)
- CodeIgniter development server running on http://localhost:8080
- Database migrations completed
- Sample user accounts created (admin, teacher, student)

## Testing Steps

### Step 1: Verify Database Schema
1. Open phpMyAdmin (http://localhost/phpmyadmin)
2. Select your database
3. Verify the `materials` table exists with the following columns:
   - `id` (INT, Primary Key, Auto Increment)
   - `course_id` (INT, Foreign Key)
   - `file_name` (VARCHAR 255)
   - `file_path` (VARCHAR 255)
   - `created_at` (DATETIME)

**Screenshot Required:** Database schema showing materials table structure

### Step 2: Test Admin File Upload
1. Navigate to http://localhost:8080/auth/login
2. Login with admin credentials
3. On the admin dashboard, you should see "Course Materials Management" section
4. Click "üì§ Upload Material" button for any course
5. On the upload form:
   - Select a file (PDF, DOC, PPT, etc. - Max 10MB)
   - Click "Upload Material"
6. Verify success message appears
7. Check `writable/uploads/materials/` folder to confirm file exists

**Screenshots Required:**
- Admin dashboard showing Course Materials Management section
- Upload form page
- Success message after upload
- File system showing uploaded file in writable/uploads/materials/

---

### Step 3: Test Material Viewing (Admin)
1. While logged in as admin
2. Click "üìÅ View Materials" for the course you uploaded to
3. Verify the uploaded material appears in the table with:
   - File name
   - Upload date
   - Download button
   - Delete button (admin/teacher only)

**Screenshot Required:** Materials list view showing uploaded files

---

### Step 4: Test Student Enrollment and Material Access
1. Logout from admin account
2. Login with student credentials
3. Navigate to the student dashboard
4. Enroll in a course that has materials
5. Verify "üìö View Materials" link appears in enrolled courses
6. Verify "üìÅ My Course Materials" section shows materials from enrolled courses
7. Click "‚¨áÔ∏è Download" button to download a material
8. Verify file downloads successfully

**Screenshots Required:**
- Student dashboard showing enrolled courses with "View Materials" link
- Student dashboard showing "My Course Materials" section
- Downloaded file confirmation

---

### Step 5: Test Access Control
1. While logged in as student
2. Try to access a course material download link for a course you're NOT enrolled in
3. Verify you receive an error message: "You are not enrolled in this course"
4. Try to access upload page directly: http://localhost:8080/admin/course/1/upload
5. Verify access is denied (redirect or error)

**Screenshot Required:** Error message when trying to access restricted material

---

### Step 6: Test Material Deletion
1. Login as admin or teacher
2. Navigate to a course's materials page
3. Click "Delete" button next to a material
4. Confirm deletion in the popup
5. Verify:
   - Material removed from database
   - Physical file deleted from writable/uploads/materials/
   - Success message displayed

**Screenshot Required:** Materials list before and after deletion

---

### Step 7: Test File Upload Validation
1. Login as admin
2. Navigate to upload page
3. Try uploading:
   - A file larger than 10MB (should fail)
   - An invalid file type like .exe (should fail)
   - A valid file (should succeed)
4. Verify appropriate error messages for failed uploads

**Screenshot Required:** Error message showing file validation

## Expected Results Summary

‚úÖ Materials table created successfully
‚úÖ Admin can upload files to courses
‚úÖ Files stored in writable/uploads/materials/ directory
‚úÖ Students can view materials for enrolled courses only
‚úÖ Students can download materials
‚úÖ Admin/Teacher can delete materials
‚úÖ Access control prevents unauthorized downloads
‚úÖ File validation works correctly
‚úÖ Database records match uploaded files

## Database Verification Queries

```sql
-- View all materials
SELECT m.*, c.title as course_title 
FROM materials m 
JOIN courses c ON c.id = m.course_id 
ORDER BY m.created_at DESC;

-- Count materials per course
SELECT c.title, COUNT(m.id) as material_count 
FROM courses c 
LEFT JOIN materials m ON m.course_id = c.id 
GROUP BY c.id, c.title;

-- View materials for enrolled students
SELECT u.name as student_name, c.title as course_title, m.file_name, m.created_at
FROM users u
JOIN enrollments e ON e.user_id = u.id
JOIN courses c ON c.id = e.course_id
JOIN materials m ON m.course_id = c.id
WHERE u.role = 'student'
ORDER BY u.name, m.created_at DESC;
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: File upload fails
- Check `writable/uploads/materials/` directory exists and has write permissions
- Verify file size is under 10MB
- Check file extension is allowed

### Issue: Download not working
- Verify file exists in `writable/uploads/materials/` directory
- Check database record has correct file_path
- Ensure user is enrolled in the course

### Issue: Access denied errors
- Verify routes are configured correctly
- Check RoleAuth filter is working
- Confirm user session is active

## Submission Requirements

For laboratory submission, include:
1. ‚úÖ Screenshot of materials table schema (phpMyAdmin)
2. ‚úÖ Screenshot of admin upload form
3. ‚úÖ Screenshot of file system with uploaded files
4. ‚úÖ Screenshot of student dashboard with materials section
5. ‚úÖ Screenshot of material download confirmation
6. ‚úÖ Screenshot of GitHub repository with latest commit
7. ‚úÖ Brief report documenting testing process and results

## Additional Features Implemented

- **Security**: File type validation, size limits, access control
- **User Experience**: Bootstrap UI, success/error messages, intuitive navigation
- **Database Integrity**: Foreign keys, proper relationships
- **File Management**: Secure file storage, organized directory structure
